# ChargeBee
I have written in react , I built this react project using webpack.
To run this project first run npm i in command prompt . 
After nodemodules are created, run npm run build-dev command.
Then run npm run start
In browser open "http://localhost:8080/".
I have left some part because of time constraint. I have an idea how we can implement those for deploy strategies part I just created the cards and left in place of creating a slider .
I have tried implementing responsiveness , but I missed it in images.
